The next step is to define a null hypothesis, which is a model of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect is not real. Then compute the p-value, which is the probability of the null hypothesis being true, and finally interpret the result of the p-value, if the value is low, the effect is said to be statistically significant, which means that the null hypothesis may not be accurate.\n",
